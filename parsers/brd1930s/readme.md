1930s parsing
=============

First of all, for future reference, how do you start a new decade?

Copy over the old code into a new folder. Change names as needed. Visit [brdmetadata.tsv](https://github.com/tedunderwood/reviews/blob/master/metadata/brdmetadata.tsv) in order to find the volIDs for volumes. Create a new metadata file in secure_volume/brd/meta, using those volIDs and start/end pages you determine manually.

Then see how it's running on the new material. In this case I noticed two issues that could be improved:

1) There were often publisher names missing in the "publisher" field but present in the lines that precede ```<endsubj>``` in the review itself. I fixed this by adding an if-statement in ```quotationmaker``` that searches for publisher names (or *partial* publisher names in the tokens preceding ```<endsubj>```).

2) The routine was failing to divide citations if the wordcount got OCR'd as something like lOOw (instead of 100w). I fixed this by creating ```ocrwordcountregex```, which catches those sorts of things. Interpreting them numerically is a task for later in the pipeline.

3) I noticed that BRD had started to include pronunciation guides for names at the botom of the page, like "CALDWELL (k√¥ld'wel)". Wrote a regex in bookmaker (```pronunciationline```) to catch these lines.

4) I noticed an increasing number of entries that begin with a capitalized word, and formally look like the beginning of a book citation, but are actually cross references. E.g., "ABBOTT, ANTHONY, pseud. See Oursler, G. F." Wrote some code around line 400 of bookmaker that looks for "See" and uses that as a clue to be skeptical. Then it looks forward; if it sees a mostly-cap line a few lines down it infers that this line is not going to be followed by reviews but is just a brief cross-reference, and can be ignored.

5) I loosened the rules about starting new book citations to allow for situations where there's not a full name but just a single title word in all caps like "AMERICAN biography, encyclopedia of." My strategy here is to look forward for a dollar sign or "ed." in the lines to come, as confirmation that the initial capitalized word is starting a book citation.

Finally, I wrote ```publisherfinder.py``` which gives me a way to dynamically and iteratively update my lists of publisher and review names by checking the ```publisher``` and ```publication``` columns in recent output for strings that are not present in the files we use to store those names. I can then manually edit the files.
